       <em>EECS Graduate Student/1st Year</em>
       <p>Hi, I am Sikai and I am currently a first year EECS Masters student here at CAL. I love travelling, watching YouTube videos and playing games. I would like to design beautiful websites so I take this cool Decal course. Here are my top 3 favourite places to eat:</p>
       <ul>
       	<li> Cheeseboard Piazza </li>
       	<li> Super Dumper Burger</li>
       	<li> Foothill Dining</li>
       </ul>
